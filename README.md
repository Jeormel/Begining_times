# Begining_times-(should read)
    Full Story about this Project(Time happend:2020)
In this repository I will upload my begining times project which I bring me to the world of coding.NOTE:It contain lot of errors and mistakes
Main part about this I had no expirience in the coding so I thought ok just build some project. After I think about it I thought what side we build websites
then I got an idea to build a ecommers website This idea inspired from my mom because my mom keep one small cloth in my village so I decided to help her but when I 
started I had a no idea about a frontend and also backend so I watch youtube tutorial and start to make it after a while I had no expirence in backed so I got a lot of 
errors in main python file(Which i used as a backend language)So I had no knowled to clear and sort it out the error and the lockdown also compleated I lost touch with 
html and css so now(2023) I don't have a idea about how I did it and how it working. I share this because I did this things with a keen to learn about the tech and 
programming world. Now I am college First year student Now I getting better in knowledge about python and so many differnt thing.
